### Basic informations about dataset 👇
The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.
- Number of rows: 20640
- Number of features (columns): 10
- The columns names are pretty self explanitory: 
👉 longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bed rooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value, and ocean_proximity.
- Target variable name : median_house_value
 ### Steps Involved 👇
 -  Load the data
 -  Explore the data
 -  Clean the data
 -  Data Visualization
 -  Transform the data
 -  Feature scaling
 -  Split the data
 -  Build the Model
 ### Model Evaluation ( Linear Regression )
 - Mean Square Error: 0.3889
 - Mean Absolute Error: 0.4444
 - Mean Absolute Precentage Error: 2.4094
 ### Conclusion 👇
 In addition to Simple Linear Regression, other options for modeling include Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, OLS Regression, and RandomForestRegressor. If you wish to explore these alternate models further, feel free to do so. Thank you. 👍
